# Reservations

## Application Purpose:

This application is designed to work as a reservation system for restaurants. This application will allow the end user to create, view, edit, and delete their restaurant's reservations. In addition, the restaurant can use the application to indicate when the reserved party has been seated and, later, when that table becomes available again. This is a useful application because it helps the restaurant keep its reservations in order so that they can better plan for each night. For each reservation, the restaurant is able to see the customer's name, phone number, table request (high top, booth, etc), time/date, the number of people included in the party, and so on.
